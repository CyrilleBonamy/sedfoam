<!--SedFOAM Manual-->

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This documentation describes the three-dimensional two-phase flow solver for sediment transport applications:  SedFoam. The solver is based on twoPhaseEulerFoam available in the official release of the open-source CFD software OpenFOAM (based on OF2.4). In this approach the sediment phase is modeled as a continuum, and constitutive laws have to be prescribed for the sediment stresses. In the proposed solver, two different inter-granular stress models are implemented: the kinetic theory of granular flows and the dense granular flow rheology &mu(I). For the fluid stress, laminar or turbulent flow regimes can be simulated and three different turbulence models are available for sediment transport: a simple mixing length model (one-dimensional configuration only), a &k-&epsilon and a &k-&omega model. 

Different benchmarks/tutorials are provided to illustrate the model capabilities: a sedimentation of spherical partiles at low Reynolds number, the laminar bed-load problem, the turbulent sheet-flow regime and different two-dimensional applications. The source code and tutorial cases are disseminated at the public website: https://github.com/sedfoam/sedfoam and detailed tutorial description.

This manual is written as the documentation of the open-source solver SedFOAM-3.0, it includes the installation procedure and a description of the model input/output files.  The details concerning the mathematical formulation and the numerical implementation can be found in Chauchat, Cheng, Bonamy, Nagel, Hsu (Geophysical Model Development, 2017, https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/4367/2017/gmd-10-4367-2017.html).

The documentation is divided into two parts, the first one is the user manual:
<ul>
<li>Section \ref install explains how to download, compile and install SedFoam.
<li>Section \ref starting gives informations on how the case directory is organised. 
<li>Section \ref tutorials describes the tutorials provided with SedFoam sources including postprocessing using a python toolbox also provided with the source and the expected results. 
<li>Section \ref inputs describes the input parameters for SedFoam 
</ul>


The second part provides informations for developers.
